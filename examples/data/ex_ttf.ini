# There are problems with UTF-8 string literals under MSVC.
# There appear to be two cases:
# 1. It thinks our source file use the local file encoding.  This mostly
#    works okay: the UTF-8 strings look like strings in an 8-bit charset and
#    will be passed through directly.  But in other locales (e.g. East Asian)
#    it won't work.
# 2. If we add a UTF-8 byte order mark (signature) then MSVC will recognise
#    the source file as UTF-8, but will then try to re-encode the strings
#    into the local charset.
# So, unfortunately, for portability to MSVC, we have to externalise UTF-8
# strings or write them out using escape codes.
